# Git-Api - Common Lisp library for accessing git repository
*Work in progress!!!*

The **git-api** is a Common Lisp library to browse through the git repository. It is a read-only library and has no functions to create commits. It supports pack files as well as plain objects. The library is CL-only and does not need any Git support library or git installed.

The intention behind creating this library was to use it to develop graphical tools for analyzing git repositories - i.e. build branch trees etc.
